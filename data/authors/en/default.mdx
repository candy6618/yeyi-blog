I am a female front-end development engineer who has worked for a number of unknown domestic private companies.

My usual work is to have a requirements meeting, write the requirements code, and study the technology of the front-end related fields. Oh, and there's been some challenging and interesting work done recently in the field of AI tagging.

At the same time, I have a three-year-old son, and I have to spend weekends with my son. No job can deprive me of my weekend time, otherwise, I will give up this job. I also like to make friends, but I prefer to make foreign friends.
